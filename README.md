# namer_app

This is a simple app that generates random word pairs and allows users to like them. Liking a word pair sends it to Favorites. 

Word pairs removed from Favorites are sent to the trash. From the trash screen, word pairs can be liked again or deleted forever.

## Getting Started

This is my first Flutter app.

Some features that were not part of the tutorial steps:
- A third screen for unliked word pairs
- Ability to re-like unliked word pairs
- Rainbow gradient font because why not
